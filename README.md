# Pandas-Bear-Classification

A new Flutter Tflite project.

## Getting Started

A Flutter application that uses TensorFlow Lite to classify images of pandas and bears. This app allows users to either take a new photo or select an existing image from their gallery for classification. The app then analyzes the image and provides a classification result along with the confidence level. The features of this app include accurate image classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model, seamless image selection from the gallery or camera, and an easy-to-use reset functionality to clear the selected image and classification results. Additionally, the app includes an 'About' section to provide insights into its purpose and functionality. The user interface is enhanced with visually appealing gradient backgrounds, tooltips for better usability, and a footer for a polished look.
